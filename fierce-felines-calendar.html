<h2>Fierce Felines Racing Series</h2>

<h3>Event Calendar</h3>
<p>
	The <strong>Fierce Felines Racing Series</strong> is a series created by the <strong>BRT Hellcatz</strong>, providing hard racing for
	women across three timezones. We believe that women need more opportunities to race against women, and that races should be as equally hard
	as some of the top mens racing in Zwift. This series provides races that should cater to all abilities, with time trials, points races,
	fairly flat road races, and hilly road races.
</p>
<p>
	For all the rules, please see the main <a href='/fierce-felines'>Fierce Felines</a> page.
